Pinecraft Backup
----------------

Coming soon...

Do not modify the backup script. Rather, if you'd like to add custom backup commands to supplement your Pinecraft backup, create a file called `backup_custom.sh` and make it executable:

`touch ~/minecraft/backup_custom.sh && chmod +x ~/minecraft/backup_custom.sh`

Then, edit that file and add any backup commands you like.
