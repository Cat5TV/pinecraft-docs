The installer will setup a "Normal" difficulty server and allow you to select between a Survival world complete with mobs, nether and more, or a Creative world to hone your skills as a master builder.

The installer attempts to detect things like how much RAM you have (and available), and adjusts the server settings based on what it finds.

**Looking For Help?** Pinecraft Installer installs Minecraft Java servers. If your question has to do with something other than *installing* a Minecraft server with Pinecraft Installer, the question likely is not for us. Questions surrounding gameplay, how to use a Minecraft server, etc., should be directed to `the Minecraft documentation <https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server>`__.
