Server Plugins
==============

The following plugins are in use on our servers:

1. bStats

This is used by plugins to quantify metrics and usage data.

2. CoreProtect

Prevents hacking on our server.

3. DiscordSRV

Connects all game servers together onto a single Discord channel.

4. dynmap

Generates visual map data for the docs (the "drone camera").

5. RedProtect

Allows users to protect their own builds and teleport to and from protected builds. Users can select which other players have access to interact in their protected areas, and even prevent mobs from being able to damage their builds.

6. SpawnProtect

Protects a set radius around the spawnpoint to prevent the area a new user encounters from being damaged by mobs or other players.

7. WorldEdit

Used by admins to correct issues, for world setup (such as quickly creating the public spawn on a new server) or for testing.
