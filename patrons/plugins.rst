Server Plugins
==============

The following plugins are in use on our servers:

CoreProtect
-----------

Prevents hacking on our server.

DiscordSRV
----------

Connects all game servers together onto a single Discord channel.

dynmap
------

Generates visual map data for the docs (the "drone camera").

RedProtect
----------

Allows users to protect their own builds and teleport to and from protected builds. Users can select which other players have access to interact in their protected areas, and even prevent mobs from being able to damage their builds.

SpawnProtect
------------

Protects a set radius around the spawnpoint to prevent the area a new user encounters from being damaged by mobs or other players.
