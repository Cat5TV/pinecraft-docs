Area Protection
===============

Introduction
------------

Our Patron servers use RP area protection mod.

How To Protect Your Build
-------------------------

You'll need fences. A lot of them. And one sign. So, get chopping down trees to get the wood, then craft fences and signs.

1. Place a fence border, square or rectangular (no odd shapes) around your build.
2. Place a single sign atop one of the fence posts.
3. Type `[rp]` on the first line and the name of your protection on the second line. If you'd like other players to have access to the area protection, place their name on the 3rd and 4th line, comma-separated.
4. If successful, the sign will say *Done*. Otherwise, it will show an error and you can walk around the fence to find the error (it will have a new sign on it).
5. Once complete, remove the sign and the fence.

**Be very careful not to create inadvertent player traps.** An example would be leaving the fence up: A user could place a dirt block on the outside of your fence and jump over it, but then would not be able to get out since they can't place blocks nor break the fence.

Please carefully read and understand `the rules <rules.html>`__ surrounding area protection. Abuse of area protection could result in restricted access to this feature.

List Your Protected Areas
-------------------------

Type `/rp list` to list all your protected areas.

Teleportation
-------------

Once you know the area name from `/rp list` you can type `/rp teleport Area_Name` to teleport to Area_Name.

Add Others
----------

You can add admins, members or leaders to your own protected areas.

Go inside your protected area and type:

Add a member: `/rp addmember username`

Add an admin: `/rp addadmin username`

Add a leader: `/rp addleader username`

Remove A Protected Area
-----------------------

Where *Area_Name* is the name from the list of the area to remove:

`/rp delete Area_Name`
`/rp yes`
