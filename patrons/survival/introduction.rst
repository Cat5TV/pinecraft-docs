Server Introduction: Patron Survival
------------------------------------

Using the Category5 TV RPi level seed, Patron Survival is a fun, collaborative world where its player against the elements.

Run North East from spawn toward the community area, complete with a working nether portal, Safe Haven to hide from night mobs and rest your head on one of the provided beds, and a village south of there, atop the hill.

Explore the world, and get as far from the community area as you can to setup your own base of operation. Or, collaborate with other players and build your base in the community area.

Patron Survival was built using Pinecraft 2.6 and is running Paper 1.16.5. It backs up all builds automatically on a 6 hour cycle.
