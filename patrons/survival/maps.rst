Survival Maps
=============

Pinecraft Map Generator scans our world once per day, and if any of the scanned regions have had signficant changes, updates our images automatically.

Here are some key areas on our Survival server.

Spawn
^^^^^

Welcome to our Patron-exclusive Survival server!

Settler's Village
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Just a short journey west of spawn, you'll find our community area. This shared space features a hillside village to the south, a functional nether portal in the heart of town, and a community garden to the north. Getting late? There's even a rustic safe haven in the north mountainside, just beyond the garden.
